## 👨🏻‍💻 About Me


When I'm not busy learning new stuff you can find me indulging in a variety of interests. I enjoy learning (not neccesary IT stuff) but also readying fantasy books, go walk with my dog, cooking for me and my dog, or trying to learn new languages (french going really hard). 🍲🧶💻

I'm about to finish my final graduation project and hopefully at the end of the year I finally will be a Software Engineer! 📚💡

Gaming is another realm where I find joy and excitement. From story telling adventures to strategic, count me in! 🎮🕹️

## ✈️ Pets and Tech



I am a pet lover, personally I take care of my 15 years old french poodle. 🐶 Currently, I'm volunteering in an NGO Adopteros Argentina where I share my IT skills and pet's love. It's a dream come true! 🐕🖥️
